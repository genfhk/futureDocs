## Disk Imaging

Disk images are created when they facilitate viewing and accessing born-digital material.
Some legacy file formats cannot be viewed in recent operating systems. Imaging this material allows it to be viewed in an emulator.

### Connect the Cables

* Connect the power supply to the forensic bridge.
* Device cables are available in the yellow case or labeled plastic drawers on the bakers rack.

#### CONNECT THE DEVICE TO POWER.

* Connect devices with external power as usual.
* Connect uncased internal devices to power through the forensic bridge with a 3M drive power cable or a Molex to 3M drive power cable.

#### HOST COMPUTER CABLES

* Connect the forensic bridge to the host computer via Firewire or USB.

#### IDE DEVICE CABLES

* Connect the blue Host side of an IDE cable to the forensic bridge.
* Connect the black side to the device.
* Set internal hard drives to single or master.
* Make sure the jumper pins on the hard drive are set to single or master.
* Look for a schematic displaying where to place a shunt on the pins or etched labels on the circuit board.
* Research the hard drive model number if you can’t find the jumper configuration on the drive.

#### POWER ON

* Switch on power on the forensic bridge. Switch on the device with transfer media.
* Look for Power, Write Block, Host, Device, and, Activity lights to turn on.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING
* Turn the device off and on again if the Activity light does not turn on after a minute. Turn the forensic bridge off and on if not resolved.
* Zip disk drives almost always need to be turned off and on before they will connect. This may also be necessary between Zip disks.
* Check device connection.
* Look for the device under Disk Utility if you don’t see a prompt indicating the device has been connected.
* When imaging legacy media the device might only appear in the FTK Imager drive list.

### Create the Disk Image
…

### Complete the transfer.

* Turn off the Tableau and the device.
* Disconnect power and data cables from the device.
* Return the device to its record carton.
* Return the power and data cables to the equipment rack.
